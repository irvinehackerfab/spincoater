# ESP32
This is a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) program that you flash onto the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) with [espflash](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/rust/book/getting-started/tooling/espflash.html).

The guide for Rust programming on ESP32 can be found [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/rust/book/preface.html).

This was generated from [esp-generate](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/rust/book/getting-started/tooling/esp-generate.html).

The `editor_configurations` folder contains default configurations for various editors. To avoid conflicting with any configurations you may have, they have no effect until you move them out into the `esp32` folder and add a `.` to the front of the name.
